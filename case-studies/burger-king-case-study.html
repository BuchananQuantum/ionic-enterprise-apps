                    <p class="blog-post-meta">November, 2021 by <a href="../case-studies.html">Ionic AppFlow</a></p>
            
                    <p>Today, design is one of the best ways to tell Burger King’s story and communicate who they are and what they’re about. Their branding is instantly recognizable thanks to its simple but iconic designs, which help make their restaurants stand out in a crowded market. And their marketing materials are both eye-catching and engaging, helping them connect with customers on a deeper level.</p>

                    <h2>Enterprise Design Systems</h2>
                    <p>Design systems have been around for a while, but they’ve become more popular in recent years as companies strive to create a more consistent experience for their customers. Burger King is one company that has embraced design systems, and its website is a great example of how they can be used to create consistency across all channels.</p>
                    <p>Android and iOS offer native software development kits (SDKs) that provide a rich library of frontend UI components, animations, and gestures. The catch is, they’re not your UI components. You can use them to create beautiful user interfaces for your apps with minimal effort, but you’re limited to the design choices that are available in the SDKs. </p>
                    <p>That can be a lot of work – but it doesn’t have to be. There are third-party libraries out there that can help make the process easier by giving you pre-made components and animations that you can use in your app without having to start from scratch. These libraries typically require some customization on your part, but they save a lot of time and hassle compared with starting from scratch.</p>
                    <p>So if you want an easy way to add some extra polish or flair to your Android or iOS app without spending too much time on development, consider using one of these third-party libraries.</p>
                    <p>A big limitation of the native SDKs is that your ability to customize the UI components - and the overall experience - is limited to whatever Apple and Google are willing to support. You have to use their pre-built library and customization options. If you have a highly custom design language, with very specific fonts, colors, or design patterns, you might not be able to replicate those patterns for your mobile applications.</p>
                    <p>And if you have an existing web-based UI library that you’d like to repurpose, you definitely won’t be able to use these components in your native app if you’re building with the Android and iOS SDKs exclusively. This means you’ll be rebuilding everything from scratch; which effectively negates the value of a shared library of reusable components—at least as it concerns mobile development.</p>


                    <h2>React Native, Flutter, and Xamarin: Limitations to Native UI Toolkits</h2>
                    <p>Flutter is different. It eschews the traditional native UI toolkits in favor of its own rendering engine, Skia. This gives Flutter a lot of control over how your app looks and feels, but it also requires more work on your part to make things look right. If you want an app that looks and behaves identically on Android and iOS, you can do it with Flutter; but if you don’t mind sacrificing a bit of parity for the sake of convenience or time savings, React Native may be a better option for you."</p>
                    <p>So what about cross-platform solutions like React Native, Flutter, or Xamarin? Each has its own benefits and drawbacks – here’s what to keep in mind when making your decision.</p>
                    <p>Flutter has been gaining a lot of traction lately as an alternative to developing mobile apps with Swift or Java. It offers some unique advantages, like its own UI library and graphical rendering engine. But the same limitations apply: you won’t be able to bring in your existing design system or web-based UI library to Flutter. Instead, you’ll have to recreate each component, and all customizations must be supported by Flutter.</p>
                    <p>In the end, teams who choose to build with the native toolkits or popular cross-platform solutions (like React Native, Flutter, or Xamarin) will find themselves recreating their design system for mobile, often without fully matching the UX and design specifications that their corporate brand and design systems would prefer to use. If you have a well-defined design system in place already – whether it’s based on web standards or tailored specifically for mobile – then using a solution like Flutter may not be the best option for your team.</p>



                    <h2>Capacitor by Ionic Enterprise Apps: The Cross-Platform Solution for Design Systems</h2>
                    <p>Second, Stencil is a library of composable web components that can be used to create custom user interfaces. It’s built on top of React and uses the same design principles as React Native, so everything you learn about building React Native apps will also apply to Stencil. </p>
                    <p>Combining Capacitor and Stencil provides a powerful solution for teams who want to bring their existing UI library to mobile. You can use your favorite web-based libraries and frameworks like Angular, Vue, or React without having to learn new skills or write any additional code. Best of all, you get fully native mobile experiences with all the performance benefits that come with it."</p>
                    <p>In plain English, this means that if you have a React-based design system in place for your web app, you can use the same components and styling when creating a native mobile app using Capacitor. However, to make sure your mobile app looks and feels right on iOS and Android devices, there are some specific considerations you’ll need to take into account such as navigation and platform-specific UI guidelines.</p>

                    <h2>Burger King’s Approach</h2>
                    <p>In a previous blog post, we talked about how Burger King decided to use React Native for their mobile app development. In this post, we want to focus on why they chose Capacitor as the bridge between React Native and native iOS and Android components.</p>
                    <p>If you take a look at Burger King's iOS or Android apps, you'll see that they look and feel totally native - but you're not using the stock iOS or Android components. That's because their design team wants to make sure that users have a consistent experience across all of BK's platforms - whether they're on their website, inside the restaurant, or using the app. And Capacitor lets them do just that by persisting their web-based UI components across web and mobile.</p>

                    <h2>Build Your Own Design System With Stencil</h2>
                    <p>Design systems are becoming increasingly important as organizations strive to create cohesive, consistent user experiences across their digital products. If you’re not Burger King and you don’t yet have a design system built out, don’t worry—Stencil can help.</p>
                    <p>Stencil is a Web Component compiler that allows you to build fully custom, standards-based Web Components that will run in any modern browser, including the UI Web View used by Capacitor. And best of all, Stencil-built components can be paired with any JavaScript framework. This makes them ideal for building a central UI library that can be shared across projects, even when dev teams are using different frameworks and tech stacks—which is common in large organizations with multiple dev teams. You can learn more about Stencil for design systems by checking out the Stencil docs, and this post from Ionic Enterprise's President John Buchanan.</p>
                    <p>Design-led brands understand that their design system is an extension of their brand. They use visual design to tell a story about who they are and what they value. If your business already has a design system built out, or a shared UI component library, the easiest way to bring those experiences to your native mobile apps is to build with Capacitor.</p>

In fact, when the company first started in 1954, it was actually called Insta-Burger King because of its focus on quick service and innovative design. But it wasn’t until the early 2000s that Burger King really began to embrace a design-led approach, with a new logo, store designs, and marketing materials.</p>
