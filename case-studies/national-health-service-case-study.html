                    <p class="blog-post-meta">August, 2021 by <a href="../case-studies.html">Ionic AppFlow</a></p>
            
                    <p>Traditional methods of communication such as phone calls or email can be insecure and unreliable due to factors such as network congestion or dropped calls. In addition, these methods can be time consuming when trying to coordinate care for multiple patients simultaneously. Secure chat apps provide an alternative solution that is both more efficient and secure than traditional methods of communication. With a secure chat app, hospital staff can quickly communicate with one another regardless of location without having to worry about the security of their communications.</p>

                    <h2>The Company</h2>
                    <p>Komed Health is transforming healthcare communication to help doctors, nurses, and other healthcare workers deliver best-in-class patient care. </p>
                    <p>The company was co-founded by Marc Bornträger and Luiza Dobre, who were motivated after visiting several hospitals and speaking with doctors and nurses. They saw the antiquated technology being used by these otherwise state-of-the-art healthcare facilities – a problem which Komed Health set out to solve. </p>
                    <p>Komed Health’s platform enables healthcare workers and their institutions to better communicate with one another through a secure real-time messaging system. This not only improves patient care but can also save lives. </p>
                    <p>The company is based in Zurich, Switzerland – a global center for medical innovation – making them ideally placed to develop this much needed solution. And given that the global market for enterprise communications is forecasted to grow from $130 billion in 2017 to $194 billion by 2021*, it’s clear that there is a lot of potential for Komed Health’s platform.</p>
                    
                    
                    <h2>The Challenge </h2>
                    <p>Komed Health saw first-hand how outdated legacy IT systems were negatively impacting healthcare organizations. Inefficient communication between nurses, doctors, and higher-ups wasn’t just making it hard for healthcare workers to share information; it was resulting in less than stellar patient care.</p>
                    <p>Marc and Luiza noted that many hospitals were using communication platforms such as Slack or WhatsApp. The problem was that the data stored on these platforms was not secure, and certainly didn’t meet the standards for privacy regulations in a hospital environment. Additionally, these platforms weren’t able to integrate with the existing healthcare IT infrastructure so that electronic medical records, lab results, information systems, and more could be shared easily.</p>
                    <p>This is where Komed Health came in – they created a messaging platform specifically for hospitals called MediLink. MediLink is HIPAA compliant and can easily integrate with any existing healthcare IT system so that nurses can quickly access patient data without having to leave their workstation. Doctors can also communicate with one another more efficiently by sharing lab results or treatment plans directly through MediLink instead of relying on insecure email communications or phone calls which often result in misunderstandings due to poor audio quality or transcription errors.</p>


                    <h2>The Strategy</h2>
                    <p>Now, let’s dive into the benefits of a cross-platform development approach. First and foremost, it’s important to remember that not all users are created equal. Your app needs to be able to cater to users on different devices, with different screen sizes, running on different versions of Android or iOS. Cross-platform development helps you do just that by allowing you to build once and deploy everywhere.</p>
                    <p>Not only does this save time and money in the long run, but it also ensures that your app looks great and performs well no matter what device your customer is using. Additionally, developing for multiple platforms can actually lead to increased discoverability – as people search for apps in their respective app stores based on platform (iOS vs Android), a cross-platform strategy gives you a better chance of being found.</p>
                    <p>When considering how best to build an effective healthcare communication platform, Komed Health first had to decide between native or cross-platform app development approaches. While native devices are known to build the richest user experience, at the time it simply wasn’t in the budget for Komed Health. That quickly led them to pursue a cross–platform development approach instead, one that enabled their team to build for iOS and Android using web technologies without sacrificing any quality from a software or hardware perspectiv . Next ,Komed Health wanted to find a development firm that their existing team could communicate to easily. Already well – versed in Angular, the Komed Health team saw value in Ionic Enterprise Apps as their contractor ; which not only allowed Komed to build using Angular, but also React Vue or JavaScript. Having the flexibility to use different frameworks for multiple projects was something The Komed Health team greatly valued ....</p>
                    <p>Lastly, Komed Health sought a pure web approach to app development that easily allowed code to be shared between their web and native platforms. The hope was to operate from one codebase that provided Komed Health with everything they needed in terms of components, functionality, and theming. Ideally, this web-first approach would simplify the app development process for Komed Health, while still resulting in a quality app that was on par with the performance of other native apps.</p>

                    <h2>The Selection</h2>
                    <p>When it comes to cross-platform mobile app development, there are a few key players in the space. React Native and Native Script are two of the most popular options, but Ionic Enterprise Apps is quickly gaining ground. Komed Health, a health tech company, recently evaluated all three platforms to see which would be the best fit for their needs.</p>
                    <p>After considering factors such as performance, cost-effectiveness, and ease of use, Komed Health found that Ionic Enterprise Apps was the ideal platform for them. Ionic’s wide range of components and plugins makes it easy to create high-quality apps without requiring outside developer talent. Additionally, Ionic’s growing community means that there is plenty of support available if you need it.</p>
                    <p>At a fraction of the cost of developing an app natively with React Native or Native Script, Ionic provides great value for companies looking to get started with cross-platform development. If you’re on the fence about which platform to choose for your next project, consider giving Ionic Enterprise a call. </p>

                    <h2>Key Benefits & Results</h2>
                    <p><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Are you looking for an app that can empower your healthcare environment? Look no further than Komed Health. Our cost-effective solution delivers a future-forward app that is easy to deploy and operate from a single codebase. This makes it easy for team members to share their work internally, which helps us create a team of experienced developers who are able to exchange ideas and collaborate more easily together. Using Capacitor, an open-source native runtime for building Web Native apps, we have benefited from native code integration that enables effective project configurations and improved developer performance. Contact us today to learn more about how we can help you achieve your goals!</p>
                    <p><strong>Continuous Improvements:</strong> If you're like most people, when you think about healthcare technology, you probably don't think about the speed of development. But at Komed Health, we believe that's one of the most important aspects of our work. That's why we use ionic enterprise to build our apps. Thanks to operating from a single codebase, the Komed Health team can iterate very quickly using the user feedback that they've gathered inside of hospitals. Instead of dealing with the requirements needed between various platforms and telling their various web developers’ different things, and then designing multiple app versions, Komed Health is able to quickly implement changes to multiple platforms with the help of ionic enterprise apps.</p>
                    <p><strong>Truly Native Experiences:</strong> If you're like many companies, you've probably used Cordova to develop your mobile app. But what if Cordova isn't meeting your needs? That's where Capacitor comes in. Capacitor is a truly native runtime that delivers for businesses in a major way. The Komed Health team had no trouble switching over from Cordova, especially since many of the existing Cordova plugins were backwards compatible with Capacitor. Through Capacitor, Komed Health was able to build and deliver custom features that further improved the overall app experience. From building out push notifications developed through custom native code to encrypting and storing data in a secure location through a custom Capacitor plugin, Komed Health unlocked the freedom to build what they wanted, when they needed it. In the words of Co-Founder, Marc Bornträger: "Capacitor really does feel like a future-forward platform, and everything that Ionic promised that it would be proved to be true for us." If you're looking for more flexibility and power than Cordova can offer, give Capacitor a try - you won't regret it!</p>
                    <p><strong>Flexibility:</strong> React, Angular, and Vue are all popular choices for front-end development. So, which one should your company choose? It depends on what you’re looking for. Angular is great if you want a more structured development process with well-defined guidelines. React is better if you want more flexibility and control over your codebase. And Vue is perfect if you want something that’s easy to learn and quick to get up and running. But what about Ionic enterprise apps? As a framework-agnostic platform, Ionic enterprise can work with any of these frameworks – so it’s the perfect company for clients that can’t decide between them. With Ionic enterprise, Komed Health has options – and that means they can always deliver the best possible app experience to their customers.</p>
