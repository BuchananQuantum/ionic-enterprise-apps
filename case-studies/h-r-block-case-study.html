                    <p class="blog-post-meta">November, 2015 by <a href="../case-studies.html">Ionic AppFlow</a></p>
            
                    

                    
                    <hr>

                    <h2>Adapting to Change</h2>
                    <p>At the beginning of 2020, the app development team at H&R Block was well on the way to providing their clients with an assisted, digital tax prep experience. The 65-year-old institution which began as an in-person tax preparation service has grown to offer do-it-yourself tax prep, a suite of financial products that help customers manage their money year-round, and a range of services to help small businesses grow and thrive.</p>
                    <p>H&R Block realized customer preferences have changed over time from in-person retail experiences to cross-channel options. They worked diligently to keep up with this demand; however, when pandemic hit right in the middle of tax season it caused them many challenges.</p>
                    <p>Kristina Wilson, IT Manager, Retail & Client Applications at H&R Block says that the organization had to accelerate it's goals for digital transformation. They had to quickly figure out streamlined ways for their roughly 80,000 tax professionals to process returns outside of the office, interact with their clients securely, and make sure they could continue to provide the world-class services their clients have come to expect.</p>


                    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                    <p>After assessing their current web and mobile strategy, Wilson and her team realized that they needed to take a closer look at their private online portal, MyBlock. The  last developers had initially created individual MyBlock applications for Android, iOS, and the web using three separate code bases. This made maintaining the app extremely inefficient.</p>
                    <p>Wilson and the team at ionic enterprise decided to build the application from the ground up in order to increase speed-to-market and flexibility. This would provide clients with the changes they needed immediately.</p>

                    <h2>The Solution</h2>
                    <p>Wilson and her team began working with Ionic Enterprise through a proof of technology in May 2020. They researched using micro app architecture in MyBlock, and wanted to be sure that Ionic would be the right partner. They quickly realized the technology would work, and started work on their mobile application using Ionic products Capacitor and Stencil in September 2020. Just a few short months later, they released their first new Progressive Web App and mobile builds through Ionic.</p>
                    <p>MyBlock has been rebuilt as a Cloud Native application leveraging a micro app architecture with Angular, which lends itself well to the Ionic platform integration. 
                        “One of the principles we focused on was increasing our speed and agility,” says John Buchanan, Solutions Architect for H&R Block Client Applications.</p>\
                    <p>Using micro apps like Secure Messaging—which manages client communication with an H&R Block tax pro directly in the app—allows for build flexibility and avoids duplicating efforts. One team could build and host the app in their environment and another team could take that capability, encapsulate it in their Ionic code base, and deploy it."</p>
                    <p>Micro apps are a great way to improve the user experience by breaking up the responsibilities of an app into smaller, more manageable pieces. This allows for a more streamlined and uncomplicated experience for the user. Ionic is a great fit for this type of development as it relies on custom HTML elements which makes it easy to use and navigate.</p>

                    <h2>The Results</h2>
                    <p>The MyBlock development team is using Capacitor to run modern, cross platform apps. This makes developer access to common functionality on each platform consistent and easy. They are taking advantage of the push notifications, camera, and in-app browser features, to name a few.</p>
                    <p>Capacitor is a new cross-platform development tool from Ionic that allows companies to create mobile apps using existing code structures. In a recent interview, Buchanan commented on how Capacitor has allowed them to use their existing code structure for their mobile apps, and take advantage of the new features offered by Capacitor.</p>
                    <p>The Ionic Enterprise development team also leans on Stencil—a Web Component compiler for building reusable frontend components that work with any JS framework—to ensure the look and feel matches seamlessly between the mobile and web application environments. By integrating the H&R Block design system, developers can easily provide the best cross-platform experience for their customers using a single codebase.</p>
                    <p>Buchanan is comparing the use of LEGO bricks to the use of components in a centralized location. He believes that you can build a scalable, extendable, and reliable solution using LEGO bricks.</p>
                    <p>H&R Block has reached their goals of increasing speed-to-market and developing an application customers enjoy using with a single codebase offering one experience across multiple applications.</p>
