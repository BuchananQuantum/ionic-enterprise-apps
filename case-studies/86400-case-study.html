                    <h2 class="blog-post-title">Why :86400 decided on Ionic Enterprise!</h2>
                    <p class="blog-post-meta">January 29, 2021 by <a href="#">Ionic AppFlow</a></p>
            
                    <p>:86400 is Australia’s first smartbank, built for smartphones. It is the only digital bank that allows customers to connect accounts from other financial institutions, giving them greater visibility of their financial picture.  </p>
                    
                    <hr>

                    <h2>What makes :86400 different from other banks?</h2>
                    <p>The biggest difference is that you can open an account without ever having to visit a physical branch. You can do everything online or on your mobile phone – from opening an account to depositing money to transferring funds between accounts. </p>
                    <p>Another big advantage of :86400 is that there are no fees for using your debit card overseas or for making withdrawals at an ATM abroad – something that often catches people out with traditional banks. And if you need help, our customer service team is available 24/7 via phone or live chat. </p>
            
                    <h3>Here are three reasons they're different: </h3>
                    <ol>
                      <li>Convenience: With no branches, it’s super easy to open an account online or on your mobile phone – wherever you are in the world! And because everything can be done remotely, there’s no need waste time queuing up at a bank branch.  </li>
                      <li>Fees: There are zero fees for using your debit card overseas or withdrawing cash from ATMs abroad – which can save you a lot of money over time! </li>
                      <li>Customer service: Our customer service team is available 24/7 via phone or live chat if you need help with anything banking-related</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                    <p>The Challenge was a great opportunity to work on something new and exciting. We were able to use the latest technologies and techniques to build a bank with a single customer channel – a mobile app. And we delivered it for day one on both Apple and Android devices!</p>
                    <p>One of our goals was to release features quickly, as often as every 2-3 weeks. This required us to be agile in our development process, deploying changes without waiting for app store approvals. The Challenge was an excellent way to learn new skills and improve our processes.</p>

                    <h2>The Strategy</h2>
                    <p>As a business owner, you know that it’s important to make your product available to as many people as possible. With a hybrid app development approach, you can build an app that works on both iOS and Android devices using only one codebase. This means less development resources are needed, and the UI will be consistent across all platforms.</p>
                    <p>If you’re like most people, you probably think of hybrid apps as a second-class citizen. You may have even heard that they perform poorly and are difficult to develop. But the truth is that hybrid apps have come a long way in recent years. Today, they offer many of the same benefits as native apps – and sometimes even more.</p>
                    <p>For starters, hybrid apps are built with web technologies like HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. This makes them easy to develop and deploy because you don’t need separate teams for each platform (iOS, Android etc.). You can use the same codebase for all platforms, which saves time and money. And since browsers have become more powerful over the past few years, programming support for hybrids has grown massively. So today’s hybrids look and feel just like most native apps – often better than some of them!</p>
                    <p>Another big advantage of hybrids is that they can be deployed through standard app stores like Apple App Store or Google Play Store without having to go through an approval process. This makes it much easier to get your app in front of users – no need to build a website or deal with other distribution channels. In fact, according to recent estimates, hybrids account for roughly 30% of all iOS App Store downloads and nearly 50% of all Google Play Store downloads. So, if you want your app reach as many users as possible quickly Hybrid hasn't always been the best option but now it's something worth considering!</p>

                    <h2>The Selection</h2>
                    <p>Ionic Enterprise Apps is important for both users and businesses. It allows customers to make better choices about the products they buy, and it gives businesses a valuable tool for understanding their customers’ needs. Through rigorous analytics and data tracking implementations. </p>
                    <p> :86400 chose Ionic Enterprise to develop their application instance because it provides the most cost-effective solution for delivering a modern app across both platforms. Ionic Enterprise also offers access to premium products and services, including experts via Ionic Enterprise’s Advisory service, as well as Appflow, a mobile DevOps solution that helps automate deployments and publish live updates directly to user devices.</p>

                    <h2>The Evolution of :86400's Mobile Banking App</h2>
                    <p>Since the upgrades, :86400 has seen a surge in customer satisfaction ratings. In the past month, we’ve achieved an average of 4.8/5 on our App Store reviews - up from 4.3/5 in March 2022. This is thanks to significant improvements made to key areas such as speed and functionality..</p>
                    <p>The experience we were able to deliver with the initial version of Ionic was well received by their customers. The upgrade to Ionic 5 has delivered even better experiences and performance. The difference in the performance between hybrid and native Apps is now marginal. We’ve been delighted with the outcome.</p>
                    <p>One of the great things about Ionic is that it gives us a common platform across different devices and operating systems - whether it be iOS, Android or Windows Mobile - so we can develop once and deploy everywhere. This saves our clients time and money, which we can then reinvest into further developing our App functionality.</p>

                    <h2>Key Benefits & Results</h2>
                    <p>Integrating Ionic Enterprise for 86 400 has been a huge success for the client. Not only did they get their app to market quickly, but they've also released around 40 versions of it since its initial deployment! </p>
                    <p>Some other benefits include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Reduced development time and costs</li>
                        <li>Increased customer engagement and loyalty</li>
                        <li>Greater visibility and reach</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>:86400 is different. It's not just a digital bank, it's the future of banking. They're growing fast and their customer satisfaction scores are through the roof within the app store along with dynamite results within the search engine to further their online success by developing a hybrid application which is readily available on all platforms. </p>
                    <p>Some metrics from their accounts!</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>225,000 accounts and counting!</li>
                        <li>They have more than $300 million in customer deposits!</li>
                        <li>650,000 transactions each day!</li>
                    </ul>
