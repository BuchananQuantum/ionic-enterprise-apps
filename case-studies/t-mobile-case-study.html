                    <p class="blog-post-meta">October, 2021 by <a href="../case-studies.html">Ionic AppFlow</a></p>
            
                    

                    
                    <hr>

                    <h2>Adapting to Change</h2>
                    <p>Ionic Enterprise has a successful track record with  development, most notably with Clips at Sprint. After the merger of T-Mobile and Sprint, the team contracted Ionic Enterprise after seeing the content management platform developed for Sprint being adopted throughout the company. Today, it has over 4,000 pieces of content and gets on average about 100,000 hits per day. While its interface may resemble YouTube's, T-Mobile credits much of its success to its work with Ionic Enterprise Apps.</p>
                    <p>Clips was initially deployed as a repository for learning media, as well as to serve content to T-Mobile employees through various channels like Adobe Experience Manager, Microsoft Sharepoint, Cornerstone, and more. However, the team quickly found that their audio content needed a more native feel - something that was more intuitive to mobile devices. Some pain points were difficulty navigating to specific episodes or continuing to play when the screen goes dark - all things T-Mobile employees expected when using Clips on their mobile devices.</p>

                    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                    <p>T-Mobile's team added contributor capabilities and a "save as episode" function to Clips. However, distributing podcasts through a Sharepoint site is not native to the mobile experience. This makes it difficult for users to download episodes, cue them up, or continue listening when they lock their device.</p>
                    <p>The team did their due diligence gathering requirements from the business and finding out what issues were mission critical and which ones were nice-to-have. They made their design comps and came to the inevitable conclusion that they would need to build a native mobile app themselves. The only catch—not one of them had ever done that before.</p>
                    <p>They knew that whatever this app would be would need to hook into Clips for its content, but that’s about where their knowledge ended. So, they dove in head first, reading every article, watching every tutorial video, and taking online courses until they felt confident enough to start building the app. It was a lot of work, but in the end they produced an amazing product that surpassed everyone’s expectations.</p>

                    <h2>The Solution</h2>
                    <p>The development team at Ionic had their work cut out for them when they decided to create a mobile app for Clips. Not only did they have to make sure that the new app was compatible with T-Mobile's existing framework, but they also had to teach themselves how to develop a with React. Fortunately, React made things a little bit easier for them.</p>
                    <p>Ionic also offered the opportunity to give the new app the unique look and feel of T-Mobile, while still incorporating mobile features—allowing the app to be a truly mobile-first, T-Mobile branded app. Ionic’s Enterprise Solution was the complete package and fulfilling all of their requirements. They were able to leverage Ionic’s cross-platform SDK, Secure Storage, Identity Vault, and Auth Connect. But what really helped support the T-Mobile team throughout the process. </p>

                    <h2>The Results</h2>
                    <p>Ionic Enterprise  and the T-Mobile team were able to build exactly what they set out to build with their app, T-Mobile Cast. The app has all the native features you’d expect from a typical podcasting app, including the ability to play episodes, download them for offline use, rate them, and share them with other users. Additionally, T-Mobile Cast supports videos due to its connection to Clips - T-Mobile's content management platform. However, the app has been delayed slightly as it undergoes new processes and compliance approvals within the company.</p>
                    <p>T-Mobile also highlighted and celebrated Ionic's small team was able to accomplish with the help and support of T-Mobile. It was because of this support they were able to develop with freedom of constraints. And having no real guidance from other teams within T-Mobile, the partnership with T-Mobile was invaluable.</p>
